# Task-3
📌 Project Title
Cat vs Dog Image Classifier using Deep Learning and Flask

🎯 Objective
To build a deep learning model that can classify images as cats or dogs, and deploy it as a web application using Flask.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python, PyTorch, Torchvision
Pretrained ResNet18 model
Flask (for web interface)
ImageFolder dataset format

🧪 What I Did
Collected and organized a dataset of cat and dog images
Applied image transforms like resizing, flipping, and rotation
Used a ResNet18 model, fine-tuned on the dataset
Handled class imbalance using weighted loss
Trained the model for 30 epochs with high accuracy
Created a Flask app where users can upload images and get predictions

✅ Result
The model predicts cats and dogs accurately
A working web app allows users to test it easily
I learned how to train models, handle data, and deploy them using Flask
